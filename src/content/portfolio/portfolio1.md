The Ax306 is a wireless over-ear headphone designed to balance precision audio engineering with a clean, unobtrusive visual presence. Created for both professional and leisure environments, the Ax306 prioritises comfort over extended listening sessions without sacrificing tonal clarity or performance.

The design brief called for a minimalist exterior that could conceal a technically complex architecture of adaptive noise cancellation, spatial audio processing, and long-range Bluetooth connectivity. The challenge lay in achieving this without adding visual weight or compromising portability.

A custom matte polymer finish, paired with a stainless inner frame, gives the Ax306 both durability and a quiet visual language. The earcups are magnetically detachable for maintenance and modular upgrades.

The Ax306 was shortlisted for the 2024 Australian Good Design Awards and is currently in use by several international recording studios and post-production houses.
